# Love2d - Coroutines and Animations

This project is based on the youtube video [Coroutines and Animation in PICO-8](https://youtu.be/tfGmjB72t0o) and the easing functions in [Animation Curves cheat sheet/library](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=40577).

I highly recommend first watching and then following along with the youtube video, and then you can pull the animation utilities and easing functions from the respective files under `src/` in this repo.

## Development

This template is based on the accessible [love2d-a11y-template](https://github.com/JRJurman/love2d-a11y-template). To run this project, you'll need to install the npm dependencies and run the included build script.

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
```

After that, you can either open `animations.love` using the love application, or you can start a web-server (which enables screen-reader support).

```sh
npm start
```
